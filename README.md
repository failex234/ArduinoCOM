# ArduinoCOM
ArduinoCOM is an simple WPF application that can send / receive commands
from the arduino.

Itself this is not very useful but when you want to pair any software event on your computer
or from the internet with your arduino a tool like this is very useful.

# .NET
The Dotnet part is responsible for connecting to the arduino and sending commands to it and
receiving and displaying the responses. It comes with a simple GUI.

# Arduino
The arduino part is responsible for reading the commands and reacting to them by for example
pulling a pin high or triggering some more advanced hardware stuff.
